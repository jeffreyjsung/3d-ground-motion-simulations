# 3d Ground-Motion Simulations of Moderate Earthquakes on the Hayward Fault
Berkeley Seismological Laboratory Research Project: Quantifying potential bias of seismic velocity model prediction data to improve accuracy of future simulations.

## Jupytext
Code and visualizations are written in Jupyter Notebooks - I am using [Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) for version control (converting from .ipynb -> .py for Git then .py -> ipynb for working).

### Convert notebook.ipynb to a .py file
Command line: jupytext --to py notebook.ipynb

### Convert notebook.py to an .ipynb file with no outputs
Command line: jupytext --to notebook notebook.py
